# Page Object Model | Selenium | Java 🙅

Page Object Model, also known as POM is a design pattern in Protractor that creates an object repository for storing all web elements. It is useful in reducing code duplication and improves test case maintenance.

In-Page Object Model, consider each web page of an application as a class file. Each class file will contain only corresponding web page elements. Using these elements, testers can perform operations on the website under test.
